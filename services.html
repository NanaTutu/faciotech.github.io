                  We provide tailor-made IT training and support for relevant stakeholders in development including
                  students, community leaders, state agencies and non-governmental organizations.
                  Our trainings focus on supporting individual farmers, traders, social workers and organizations to
                  leverage technology in designing appropriate solutions for common socio-economic challenges in rural
                  communities.</br>
                  We also undertake structured basic IT training using our functional curriculum to enable young people
                  with little or no IT skills to become IT literate.</br>
                  These trainings are part of our core mandate of improving IT literacy in rural communities.
                  In view of our strong commitment towards information technology education and the need to remove all
                  barriers that limit people for pursuing IT, we provide limited scholarships for passionate young
                  people interesting in pursuing IT-related courses to enable them concentrate and fully benefit from
                  the intensive theory and practice of their chosen IT field.

                <h4>Agricultural Innovation</h4>
                <p>
                  Agriculture is the mainstay of rural communities, yet it is plagued with many challenges that deprive
                  farming communities of maximum output in the sector. Technological advancement has made it possible to
                  tackle challenges involved in irrigation, ploughing, land surveillance, harvesting, food storage, pest
                  and disease control among others in a cost effective way.</br>
                  Faciotech’s approach includes educating farmers on appropriate technologies that simplifies their
                  activities, makes them more productive and ultimately increases their potential for profits.</br>
                  Key in our agricultural service solution is our drone services for varied purposes. Our drone for pest
                  control replaces traditional pesticide spraying as a better alternative because it is easier, faster
                  and cheaper.</br>
                  The drones also make it easy to sow seeds efficiently over large tracts of land. In addition to this,
                  we are able to provide farmland surveillance activities such as monitoring for weeds, pests,
                  irrigation and fertilizer shortage</br>
                  The high-resolution aerial photography and video service also makes crop and livestock farming
                  operations easier while we provide comprehensive reporting systems

                <h4>Land Management</h4>
                <p>
                  Faciotech is leading the innovation for managing and securing lands and other real estates using
                  technology. Through its digital platform, it is contributing to addressing the challenge of high
                  vacancy prevalent in most parts of Ghana and bridge the gap between real estate developers and home
                  seekers.</br>
                  In spite of the huge housing deficit in the country, vacancy rate of buildings remain high. While the
                  situation has in part been attributed to the inability of home seekers to afford available properties,
                  research shows that the daunting task of finding suitable homes from the vast available homes is a
                  significant contributor to the problem.</br>
                  Despite the increase in the housing stocks in recent times, vacancies rates are still rising with
                  worse housing conditions. Our research indicates a disconnection between real estate developers and
                  home seekers in Ghana. That is, a situation where home developers are either developing for a
                  non-existing market or home seekers are not able to locate their desired properties due to
                  non-availability of data.</br>
                  We work with real estate businesses to implement our robust yet simple solution that will assist them
                  to reach the ideal homebuyers. We envision the possibility of bridging the disconnect and knowledge
                  gap of the industry.

                <h4>Technology for Social Causes</h4>
                <p>
                  We believe in the power of grassroots mobilization and local community causes. That is why we are
                  passionate about supporting groups and organizations to deploy technology in creating awareness on
                  social issues, undertake public sensitization campaigns and mobilize citizens for social causes.</br>
                  We create online platforms to serve all these purposes including the deployment of crowd funding
                  technology solutions to enable public donations towards a social good.</br>
                  This solution is particularly important as it can help small and medium scale businesses raise funds
                  to support their enterprises. Beyond donations, the platform also supports exchange of ideas and
                  sharing of stories to encourage users.</br>
                  Our focus on NGOs ensure that we guide them to maintain a positive online presence and achieve their
                  digital goals. We do this by creating fully functional websites at highly discounted costs to enable
                  them reach wider audiences.</br>
                  Consultancy services are also available to support NGOs to leverage on the internet to promote their
                  initiatives using dynamic strategies including creative content and is able to drive audience
                  engagement and participation.

                <p>
                  Creating innovations to deal with complex issues requires extensive research on various social and
                  economic issues. This is one of our fortes at Faciotech.</br>
                  Our team of dedicated researchers maintain a high level of discipline and skill in undertaking cutting
                  edge research that presents accurate results critical for making important decisions in the areas of
                  business, economy, agriculture or social undertakings.</br>
                  Technology plays an important role in this delivery, either internally for our organization’s growth
                  or external for third-party enterprises that hire our service in their quest to come up with viable
                  solutions to solve complex societal issues.</br>
                  Having empirical evidence helps to create innovations that can be employed to increase efficiency.
                  That is why research is a pivotal to our success at Faciotech.

                  on Land, Peace and Justice Strong Institutions, Partnerships to achieve the Goal.</br>
                  Our aim at Faciotech is to use technology to work towards achieving all the goals and deliberately
                  share information about the linkages between technology and these goals through symposia and
                  interactive media.</br>
                  We are also intentional about using our online platforms whip up interest from the public towards
                  contributing their quota towards the achievement of the goals.
